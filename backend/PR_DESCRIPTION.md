# VibeSynch Backend Code Refactoring

This PR refactors the backend code to follow a more structured and modular approach while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Changes

- Reorganized the codebase into modules with clear responsibilities:
  - `config` for application configuration and environment variables
  - `services` for business logic and external API interactions
  - `routers` with feature-specific sub-modules

- Separated Spotify API functionality:
  - Created a dedicated service layer for Spotify API interactions
  - Split routes into logical groupings

- Improved code organization:
  - Reduced code duplication
  - Made the codebase more maintainable
  - Followed FastAPI best practices

## Migration

A migration guide has been created to document the changes and help the team understand the new structure. See `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for details.
