# Migration Guide

This document provides instructions for migrating from the current codebase structure to the new modular structure.

## Overview of Changes

We've reorganized the codebase into a more modular structure following FastAPI best practices:

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py                  # Main application entry point
│   ├── __init__.py              # Package marker
│   ├── config/                  # Configuration
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── settings.py          # Environment variables and app settings
│   ├── auth/                    # Authentication (kept as is)
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── firebase_auth.py     # Firebase authentication
│   ├── routers/                 # API routes
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── user.py              # User-related endpoints (kept as is)
│   │   └── spotify/             # Spotify-related endpoints
│   │       ├── __init__.py
│   │       ├── auth.py          # Spotify OAuth endpoints
│   │       └── songs.py         # Song-related endpoints
│   └── services/                # Business logic services
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── spotify_service.py   # Spotify API interaction logic
└── requirements.txt             # Project dependencies
```

## Migration Steps

1. Backup your current code
2. Copy new files to their respective locations
3. Test the application
4. Verify that all functionality works as expected

## Key Changes

1. **Modular Structure**: Code has been organized by feature and responsibility
2. **Separation of Concerns**: 
   - `routers/` contains API endpoint definitions
   - `services/` contains business logic
   - `config/` contains app configuration
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility
4. **Better Code Organization**: Related code is grouped together

## Testing After Migration

Test the following functionality:

1. User authentication with Firebase
2. Spotify API integration
   - Song search
   - Artist discovery
   - Genre recommendations
3. Spotify OAuth flow
4. Classification endpoints

## Reverting (if needed)

If you need to revert the changes:

1. Restore your backup
2. Verify the original functionality

## Future Improvements

Consider these improvements for the future:

1. Add proper database integration
2. Add caching layer for Spotify API calls
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add request/response logging middleware
5. Set up proper environment-specific configuration
